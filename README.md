# SalesDetails-CSV
This project involves designing a backend system to efficiently ingest, normalize, and analyze a large-scale CSV dataset containing historical sales data with potentially millions of records. The goal is to structure the raw data into a well-optimized relational database and expose it via a RESTful API for further analysis and reporting.
